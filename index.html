        <h2>Ahmedabad</h2>

        <p>
          The History of Ahmedabad begins in the eleventh century with King
          Karandev - 1, the Solanki Ruler. He waged a war against the Bhil King
          Ashapall or Ashaval, and after his victory established a city called
          Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati. The Solanki rule lasted until
          the thirteenth century, when Gujarat came under the control of the
          Vaghela dynasty of Dwarka. Gujarat was conquered by the Sultanate of
          Delhi at the end of the thirteenth century.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ahmedabad was built in an open and spacious plain in the immediate
          vicinity of Ashaval to the east of Sabarmati. It then comprised of a
          smaller area now known as the Bhadra Fort or the citadel of Bhadra. In
          1487, Mahmud Begada, the grandson of Ahmed Shah, fortified the city
          with an outer wall 10 km (6 miles) in circumference and consisting of
          twelve gates, 189 bastions and over 6,000 battlements. The City was
          planned according to the ancient Indo-Aryan tradition of a royal
          capital with main roads, thoroughfares and subsidiary roads.

        <h2>Jaipur</h2>

        <p>
          The history of Jaipur began when the Jaipur Kingdom was formed after
          succeeding the vibrant and prosperous kingdom of Amber. The colourful
          city was founded by Maharaja Jai Singh II, also known as Sawai Jai
          Singh in 1727. No doubt that Jaipur is a well-designed city as its
          founder was a famed mathematician and astronomer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Vidyadhar Bhattacharya was a Brahmin Scholar from Bengal who aided
          Sawai Jai Singh in laying out the city's architecture. Major places,
          roads and squares took 4 years for their completion and each was
          constructed keeping in mind the techniques of Vastu Shastra.

        <h2>Bikaner</h2>

          height="180"

        <p>
          The Junagarh Fort of Bikaner is a magnificent structure around which
          the city of Bikaner grew up. The fort was initially called Chintamani
          and later renamed the Junagarh or Old fort in the 20th century. The
          foundations of the Junagarh fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika.
          However, it existed just as a stone fort then. The present grand
          structure was inaugurated on 17th February 1589.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The palaces inside the fort, the gardens, balconies, kiosks, etc.,
          depict a composite architectural style influenced by the different
          rulers' cultural differences and foreign inspirations. The unique
          monuments on display in the fort represent 16 generations of rulers in
          Bikaner starting from the late 16th century.

        <h2>Dwarika</h2>

        <p>
          Dwarka on the western tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula is clubbed with
          the holiest sites in India – the Char Dhams that include Badrinath,
          Puri and Rameshwaram. It is believed that Lord Krishna arrived here
          from Braj in Uttar Pradesh to build the city. The temple was
          established by his grandson. It is at the cusp of the Gomti River and
          the Arabian Sea, providing a scenic backdrop to the spiritual site. It
          is said that Dwarka was submerged under the sea six times and what we
          see now is its seventh avatar.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The temple itself has a fascinating legend. The original structure was
          destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the
          15th-16th century. It was also feted by Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th
          century Hindu theologian and philosopher.

        <h2>Somnath</h2>
        <img
          src="images/somnath.jpg"
          alt="Bikaner"
          height="180"

          class="img"
          style="float: left; margin-right: 10px"
        />
        <p>
          Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold;
          this was rebuilt by Ravana in silver, by Krishna in wood and by
          Bhimdev in stone. The current serene, symmetrical structure was built
          to traditional designs on the original coastal site: it’s painted a
          creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large, black
          Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines,
          known as jyotirlinga. A description of the temple by Al-Biruni, an
          Arab traveller, was so glowing that it prompted a visit in 1024 by a
          most unwelcome tourist – the legendary looter Mahmud of Ghazni from
          Afghanistan. At that time, the temple was so wealthy that it had 300
          musicians, 500 dancing girls and even 300 barbers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mahmud of Ghazni took the town and temple after a two-day battle in
          which it’s said 70,000 defenders died. Having stripped the temple of
          its fabulous wealth, Mahmud destroyed it. So began a pattern of
          destruction and rebuilding that continued forcenturies. The temple was
          again razed in 1297, 1394 and finally in 1706 by Aurangzeb, the Mughal
          ruler. After that, the temple wasn’t rebuilt until 1950.

        <h2>Delhi</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest reference to a settlement in the Delhi area is found in
          the Mahabharata, an epic narrative about two groups of warring
          cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, both descendants of the prince
          Bharata. According to the narrative, a city called Indraprastha (“City
          of the God Indra”), built about 1400 BCE, was the capital of the
          Pandavas. Although nothing remains of Indraprastha, legend holds it to
          have been a thriving city.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first reference to the place-name Delhi seems to have been made in
          the 1st century BCE, when Raja Dhilu built a city near the site of the
          future Quṭb Mīnār tower (in present-day southwestern Delhi) and named
          it for himself.
